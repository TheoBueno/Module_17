#  Title of the Repository: Routers and Catalogs

## Description of Repository:

  This Repo consists of the Module 17 exercises, the creation of a book cataloging app, 
and learning inner navigation with # and routers.
 
## How to Use: The Book Catalog:
  It takes a JSON file of books and catalogs them by most relevant information and makes 
them available in an easy to read format.

## Roadmap of future improvements: 
  Adding a search bar would be a useful function for a larger database

## How to Use: Routing:
  One can use the links on top of the page to navigate without needind to hit servers for
more data.

## Roadmap of future improvements: 
  Integrating this onto my portifolio could be useful.
